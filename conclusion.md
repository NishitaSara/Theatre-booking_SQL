The development of the Theatre Seat Booking Management System miniproject using Python for the front end and MySQL for the backend has been a significant endeavor,
offering valuable insights into the integration of database management systemswith user-friendly interfaces for streamlined theatre operations. 
Throughout the project, we have successfully leveraged the capabilities of Python's Tkinter library to create an intuitive and interactive front end,
allowing patrons to browse shows, select seats, and complete bookings seamlessly.

By implementing MySQL as the backend database management system, 
we have established a robust foundation for storing, managing, and querying data related to shows, seats,
bookings, and customers. 

This backend infrastructure enables efficient data retrieval, updates, and reporting, 
contributing to the overall effectiveness and performance of the Theatre Seat Booking Management System.
